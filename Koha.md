 # Installing KOHA

## First Thoughts and Feelings

This is going to go better than the Omeka install because there are actual step by step instructions that I need

## Tips for actually setting up Omeka

Follow along with Dr. Burnâ€™s steps in the book 
REREAD everything
Be very very careful when adding your 8080 or you will not be able to access your site
## Using KoHa

It took a lot of playing around in KOHA to somewhat understand how to work the site. 
I am now able to add patrons quite easily but adding books is another story.
Still struggling to figure out how to add records.
Need to brush up on MARC cataloging to actually be any good at this site!

## Final Thoughts and Feelings

This was not nearly as hard to install in my opinion as the Omeka was but it is much more difficult for me to use in my opinion. 
It does not feel user friendly but maybe I am just bad at it. 
Omeka I was familiar with from my other courses so it was easier. 
This is going to take a much bigger learning curve.
