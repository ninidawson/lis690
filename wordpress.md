# Installing Wordpress

## Step One: Check your system

The first step as always is to go to Dr. Burn's page and read through this week’s notes. 
Go to [Dr. Burn's Github Page] (https://cseanburns.net/WWW/systems-librarianship/12-learn-git-and-github.html)

You will need to check your system by inputting the following codes
‘php --version’
‘mysql --version’

Follow along with the commands on Dr. Burn’s page
In order to add new software and update the servers

## Step Two: Download and Extract

Follow the instructions on Dr. Burn’s page
To download the wordpress information
And the extract what is needed from the zip files

## Step Three through Six: 

These are very code heavy steps and it is best to follow along

In the section for changing the name of the wordpress blog, I changed mine to Dawson Archives. 
**This will change how you access your site!**


##Thoughts and Feelings

I felt very confident in the assignment this week. 
There were definitely moments where I needed 
To look through Element but overall, I think it went well.
